Skype Bot using node.js

Initialize as a npm project:
    npm init
this will create a package.json file.

Install restify into the repository as the REST framework:
    npm install --save restify

You should add  to .gitignore

You have to get the Skype API https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SkypeSMS/Shared%20Documents/Agents/skype-sdk.tar.gz
Install the Skype API for node.js:
    npm install --save <path>/skype-sdk.tar.gz

Write the JavaScript to drive the bot using the Skype SDK.
See server.js here https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/bots/docs/tutorials/simple-nodejs

You will need a Bot ID, App ID, and App secret to run the server. You get those
by registering. ??Which of the three different places gives you which?

Write up the three different places the bot has to be registered.
Bot Framework
Microsoft App
Skype Bot

The backend code has to be hosted somewhere using SSL with officially signed
cert. I used ngrok successfully to host it locally. ?? get the URL for ngrok

Setting the environment variable
    set DEBUG=skype-sdk*

(yes with the asterisk) gives you debugging output from the SDK

I'm creating a LUIS (https://www.luis.ai) application called Health Coach.

Enable Action Binding to MS Bot Framework:
app id: bea3b9f7-c53e-4857-b1fb-18dff17bf098
app secret: 75605898b4974d65a740afdca43d6702

These came from where I registered the app in the Bot Framework.
